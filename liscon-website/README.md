# Liscon Website 

This is a development version of the Liscon website for viewing tokens/tickets. 

With this example you can configure it to read from real tokens or those generated via the ticket-issuer example in this repository.

Once a ticket is available the token negotiator will read this and load
the ticket graphic into view. This is a simple example of what can be done with such technology, please explore the possibilities of token attestations can do for your project and ideas. 

## Serve
